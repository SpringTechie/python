In python we have list data structure to support array.
What is List?
It is ordered
It is changeable(mutable)
Allows duplicates
Indexed
List is used to store a group of values.
It is represented as [].
In list we can store any type values either same type or diff types off values.
list = [] # empty list
list1 = [1,2,3,4] # with values.
list2= [1,"ar",1.8,'c'] # with diff type values.

list elements are ordered and modifiable.
elements are always inserted at the end.
List allows duplicate values.
we have list constructor to create a list object.
ll = list(("arun","pawan"))
