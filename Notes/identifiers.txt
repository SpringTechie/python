Used to represet a variable
a = 12;
a-z, A-Z,0-9,_
length limit  no length limit to declare any variable .
variable names always should be meaingful.
variable names always should starts with small letters
if we have two words in variable names, then scecond word should starts with uppercase.
x = 10 public
_x = 10 protected
__x = 10 private
__x__ = 10 magic variable
To define multiple variable in oneline x,y,z = 23,45,45,Remember number variable should match with number of values.
To define multiple variable with same value x=y=z = 23v
variable names are case sensitive
global Variable:
It is created outside of all the functions.

Local variable: It is created inside the function.
To convert any local variable to global we need to declare local variable as global : global x


Reserved Words:
Inbuild words that specify some action
True,False, None (absence of value or no value is present)
if , elif, else
and or is not
while for break continue return yield in 
try except finally raise assert 
import from as class def pass 
global lambda del with non local
We should not use Reserved as variable,class ,function names.
