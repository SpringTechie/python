Dictinaries:
This data structure stores data as key value pair.
Person:
{
    "id":1,
    "name":"arun",
    "age":23,
    "lucky_number":23

}
All keys inside a dic should Strings.

properties:
1.Ordered
2.Changeble
3.won't allow duplicates.(it wont allow duplicates keys, but allow duplicates value.)
Represented by {}. type of this is "dict"
To find the length we have len()
To create we have constructor: dict()

To access the any entry from Dictinaries we have two ways:
1.dic_object["key"]
2.dic_object.get("key")

To get all the keys from Dictinaries : dic_object.keys()
To get all the values from Dictinaries : dic_object.values();


updating:
to add any key to existing dic we have use = dic_object["key"]= "value"
to update any key inside the dic we have use = dic_object["key"]= "value"

if key present it will update, else it adds new key.

we have update method to update any value.
dic_object.update({key:value})

Removing:
to remove pop("key") : removes specified key.
to remove last inserted item from dic: popitem();
To remove all entries of dic : clear() , still object is present without any data
To remove the object from memory: del dic_object. It removes object from memory

To check any key present inside a dic we use : in operator
