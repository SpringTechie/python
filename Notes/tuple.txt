Tuple : It is a collection used to store multiple data type values into a single variables.
Property:
It is ordered.
It is unchangeable : meaning once we create we cant modify.(add or remove or update)
Allow duplicates.
indexed.

To represent Tuple we use = ()
When we create a tuple with one item, then we have to add comma after the first value, if not python treats it has 
normal String

we have tuple constructor
tuple()
Accesing: We are trying to access value from the list or tuple or String which is not in index range
then we get one error called IndexError.

Unpacking= We can extract the tuple values into a individual variables

if the number of =variables is less than number of values.you can add * to variable so it will store remiamiing values as list.
t=(1,2)
(odd,even) = t

t=(1,2,3,4,5,6)
(odd,even,*remain) = t
here 1 is assinged to variable odd and 2 is assinged to even
Note: Number variables must match the number of values inside a tuple
to find index of element inside a tuple we have index(element) method
if the specified element is not present inside the tuple we get error called ValueError.
example:ValueError: tuple.index(x): x not in tuple




1,2,3,4,5,6,7,5,6 = input type = list 

convert input to set = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

[
{
    empId-5, emoName, empSal
}
