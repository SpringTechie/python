loops is used to iterate over a collection.
for loop: if we know exact number of iterations.
while loop: if we dont know exact number of iterations.
in python we can write else block for and while loop.
syntax:
for ():
    
else :

this else block is executed after the for loop conditon fails.

How to break and skip one iteration in loops.
break : is  used to break the complete loop. Write the break only inside the if statement.
continue: is used to skip the particular iteration.
Note: break statement breaks entire loop but continue only skips the particular iteration.

Scenario: 
1.I want print even btw 1 to 100 : Use for loop.
2. I want print 100 even numbers. : Use While loop.
